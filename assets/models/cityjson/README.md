These CityJSON test models are from https://github.com/cityjson

The test files we use for simple test cases are: 

* csol           one CompositeSolid: 2 adjacent unit cubes, valid
* cube           a unit cube, valid
* msol           one MultiSolid: 2 unit cubes that are not adjacent, valid
* msurface       one MultiSurace with 5 surfaces, valid
* tetra          a tetrahedron, valid
* tetra_1flip    tetra with one face badly oriented, invalid     
* torus          a unit cube with a genus of one, valid
* twocube        one object as two geometries: 2 unit cubes adjacent (sharing a face), valid
